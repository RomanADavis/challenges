\"I fell in love,\" I knew, I said.
\"It wouldn't last,\" I knew, I read.
\"The Gods have different plans for you,\" I heard my parents say.
But every day I'm growing old and gray.

\"I miss her now!,\" my soul would cry.
Every day I'm praying that I could die.
\"Is this what life had in store?,\" I say,
\"Should all that's gold turn into clay?\"
